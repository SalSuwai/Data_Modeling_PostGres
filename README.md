# Data_Modeling_PostGres
 In this project, I'll model the data with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python.  I will define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus,  and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
